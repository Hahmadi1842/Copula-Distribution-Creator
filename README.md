# Copula-Distribution-Creator
this code Generate the Copula Distribution for input vectors
Copula: By applying the CDF transformation to all of the random
variables, a transition to a common domain is obtained and dependency
modeling is implemented. This transformation leads to the division of
stochastic model into two fundamental components: (1) The one-dimensional
marginal distribution and (2) The multi-dimensional stochastic
dependency structure between the ranks of input random variables.
Copulas are functions that join one-dimensional marginal
distributions into multivariate distribution functions. The random
variables X and Y with CDFs FX and FY , are joined by Copula C if their
joint distribution can be written as
FXY (x, y) = C (FX (x), FY (y))
